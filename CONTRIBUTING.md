# How can I Contribute

All contributions are welcome, If you have something you would like to add to this library add a feature request and we will get in touch as soon as possible.

Please submit contributions through pull requests.

We will be building out the documentation to describe all of the parts to make it as simple as possible to contribute. Watch this space!
